/// ## The Processor trait
///
/// Processors define the logic spawning jobs such as
///  - The job's name
///  - The job's default queue
///  - The job's default maximum number of retries
///  - The job's [backoff
///    strategy](https://docs.rs/background-jobs/0.4.0/background_jobs/enum.Backoff.html)
///
/// Processors also provide the default mechanism for running a job, and the only mechanism for
/// creating a
/// [JobInfo](https://docs.rs/background-jobs-core/0.4.0/background_jobs_core/struct.JobInfo.html),
/// which is the type required for queuing jobs to be executed.
///
/// ### Example
///
/// ```rust
/// use background_jobs_core::{Backoff, Job, MaxRetries, Processor};
/// use failure::Error;
/// use futures::future::{Future, IntoFuture};
/// use log::info;
/// use serde_derive::{Deserialize, Serialize};

///         info!("Processing {}", self.count);

///         Box::new(Ok(()).into_future())
///     }

///     const NAME: &'static str = "IncrementProcessor";
///     const QUEUE: &'static str = "default";
///     const MAX_RETRIES: MaxRetries = MaxRetries::Count(1);
///     const BACKOFF_STRATEGY: Backoff = Backoff::Exponential(2);
/// }
///
/// fn main() -> Result<(), Error> {
///     let job = MyProcessor::new_job(MyJob { count: 1234 })?;
